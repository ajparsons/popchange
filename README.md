PopChange: Enabling Small Area Comparisons of Census Data since 1971 for Great Britian

This repository contains the R code used to generate the grids from the original census geographies (output areas or enumeration districts) for the PopChange project. The [project website](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/geography-and-planning/research/popchange/introduction/) contains more information on the research project including current research papers.

For information on how to use the code to generate your own grids, please see [Process for Running Code](process-for-running-code.md).
